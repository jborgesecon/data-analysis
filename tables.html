RETURNHello deepthink! I hope you are doing well in this lovely evening.

I came for you for advice. I'm building this python streamlit app for my client. he is a Brazilian investor, and my app will help him have more control over his networth and also automate some repetitive tasks. 

So far the app was doing great, until he asked me to add a page with a selic (kind of a Brazilian treasury bill interest rate) index calculator, so he could quickly input his data and see how it would perform no selic. I'm struggling on calculating it, so I will give you a descriptive detail on what I thought and what I have done so far, and I want you to give me suggestions, based on the best practices and the existing techniques used for other people to create those calculators. 

here is what I have done in the page: 
first: I performed a webscraping (with selenium and chrome drive, for the table there is not static, by dynamically created by JavaScript) on the relevant oficial website containing the selic interests in all the given time intervals (not always round, sometimes 30 days, sometimes 18 days, sometimes 50 days, it's an unpredictable interval), so for example, between '2024-1-3' and '2024-3-14', the was a total interest of 1.21%, and this goes to the dataframe df_reference. I then prompted the user if he wants to add a csv or manually input, this will generate 'df_input'. both df_reference and df_input are exemplified as the following:

    <table border="1"> \\df_input

I created this html for you, because I thought it might help you understand the structures. 

After that, I faced the first dillema: I could round up by month, and if the investment was made before an arbitrary date (let's say day 12th of each month), then it does count the month interest (else, it would skip the first month and start counting from the second), same for the date of withdraw. 

But I realized that this is not alligned with the best practices, and I could sacrifice too much precision by doing so... 

I then had a second idea: I would MANUALLY create another dataframe with the relative daily interest rate using the intervals and the relative compound interest formula, and then iterate throught all the days between the date of the investment and the date of withdraw, and multiply the pricipal amount by (1 + i1) * (1*i2) .... for every value on len(custom_daily_interest['daily_interest']).

this is super hard and tedious, but gives me a more precise calculation. that's why I came to ask you... am I on the right track? Is there a better way to create a selic calculator for my website? am I overengineering what was supposed to be simple?
